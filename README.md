## My process

- Edited README.md
- Started with mobile design 
- Created index.html in design folder
- Created style.css

### Built with

- Semantic and landmarks HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Media query should be in rem, and it should target a smaller screen size, maybe around 50rem or so.
  
- Performance-wise, it's better to link fonts in the <head> of the HTML then using @import.
  
- if it is happening at totally different places to the design at the same screen widths then the reasons are: 
  
  - incorrect font styles (family or size)
  - incorrect max width on the component

Those are where your adjustments would need to be

### Continued development

- css reset
- css grid
- vertical-align
- IDs as element anchors

### Useful resources

- [A (more) Modern CSS Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - This helped me CSS reset.
  
- [Media queries](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/#media-queries-7) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand more about media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [What ID attribute is REALLY for](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/id-attribute-masterclass/) - I learn that never style on ID attribute
