### What I learned

- Media query should be in rem, and it should target a smaller screen size, maybe around 50rem or so.
- Performance-wise, it's better to link fonts in the <head> of the HTML then using @import.

### Continued development

- css reset
- css grid
- vertical-align

### Useful resources

- [A (more) Modern CSS Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - This helped me CSS reset.
  
- [Media queries](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/#media-queries-7) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand more about media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
